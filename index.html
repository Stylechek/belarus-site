    <h1>Culture and art</h1>
    <p3>The history of Belarus goes back to the distant past. Slavic tribes were located on its territory, and later principalities such as Polotsk and Turov were formed. In the 14th century, Belarus became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which became an important stage in the formation of its cultural identity. The influence of Lithuanian, Polish and Russian cultures has created a unique synthesis that can be seen in language, architecture and folk traditions.</p3>

    <h1>Nature and ecology</h1>
    <p4>The nature of Belarus is also impressive in its diversity. Unique nature reserves, such as Belovezhskaya Pushcha, are home to rare species of flora and fauna. Belarusian forests, lakes and rivers create incredible landscapes that attract tourists and researchers. Caring for nature and the environment is becoming an increasingly relevant topic in the country, especially in light of global climate change.</p4>
